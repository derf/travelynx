travelynx - Railway Travel Logger
---

[travelynx](https://finalrewind.org/projects/travelynx/) allows checking into
individual public transit vehicles (e.g. buses, ferries, trams, trains) across
most of Germany, Switzerland, Austria, Luxembourg, Ireland, and parts of the
USA. Thus, it provides a log of your railway journeys annotated with real-time
delays and service messages, if available. It supports german railways and
trains exposed by the Deutsche Bahn [IRIS
Interface](https://finalrewind.org/projects/Travel-Status-DE-IRIS/) as well as
regional and local transit exposed by supported [HAFAS
Instances](https://finalrewind.org/projects/Travel-Status-DE-HAFAS/).  Support
for EFA instances and bahn.de is under way.

You can use the public instance on [travelynx.de](https://travelynx.de) or
host your own. See the Installation and Setup notes below.

Dependencies
---

 * perl â‰¥ 5.20
 * carton
 * build-essential
 * libpq-dev
 * git

Installation
---

travelynx depends on a set of Perl modules which are documented in `cpanfile`.
After installing the dependencies mentioned above, you can use carton to
install Perl depenencies locally. You may alsobe able to use cpanminus;
however this method is untested.

In the project root directory (where `cpanfile` resides), run

```
carton install --deployment
```

and set `PERL5LIB=.../local/lib/perl5` before executing any travelynx
commands (see configs in the examples directory) or wrap them with `carton
exec`, e.g. `carton exec hypnotoad index.pl`

Setup
---

First, you need to set up a PostgreSQL database so that travelynx can store
user accounts and journeys. It must be at least version 9.4 and must use a
UTF-8 locale. The following steps describe setup on a Debian 9 system;
setup on other distributions should be similar.

* Write down a strong random password
* Create a postgres user for travelynx: `sudo -u postgres createuser -P travelynx`
  (enter password when prompted)
* Create the database: `sudo -u postgres createdb -O travelynx travelynx`
* Copy `examples/travelynx.conf` to the application root directory
  (the one in which `index.pl` resides) and edit it. Make sure to configure
  db, cache, mail, and secrets.
* Initialize the database: `carton exec perl index.pl database migrate`
  or `PERL5LIB=local/lib/perl5 perl index.pl database migrate`

Your server also needs to be able to send mail. Set up your MTA of choice and
make sure that the sendmail binary can be used for outgoing mails. Mail
reception on the server is not required.

Finally, configure the web service:

* Set up a travelynx service using the service supervisor of your choice
  (see `examples/travelynx.service` for a systemd unit file)
* Configure your web server to reverse-provy requests to the travelynx
  instance. See `examples/nginx-site` for an nginx config.
* Install a `timeout 5m perl index.pl work -m production` cronjob. It is used
  to update realtime data and perform automatic checkout and should run
  every three minutes or so, see `examples/cron`.

You can now start the travelynx service, navigate to the website and register
your first account. There is no admin account, all management is performed
via cron or (in non-standard cases) on the command line.

Please open an issue on <https://github.com/derf/travelynx/issues> or send a
mail to derf+travelynx@finalrewind.org if there is anything missing or
ambiguous in this setup manual.

Note that Deutsche Bahn have put parts of their API behind an IP reputation
filter. In general, checkins with the bahn.de backend will only be possible if
travelynx is accessing it from a residential (non-server) IP range.  See the
dbris bahn.de proxy / proxies setting in `example/travelynx.conf` for
workarounds.

Updating
---

It is recommended to run travelynx directly from the git repository. When
updating, the workflow depends on whether schema updates need to be applied
or not.

```
git pull
carton install --deployment # if you are using carton: update dependencies
chmod -R a+rX . # only needed if travelynx is running under a different user
if perl index.pl database has-current-schema; then
    systemctl reload travelynx
else
    systemctl stop travelynx
    perl index.pl database migrate
    systemctl start travelynx
fi
```

Note that this is subject to change -- the application may perform schema
updates automatically in the future. If you used carton for installation,
use `carton exec perl ...` in the snippet above; otherwise, export
`PERL5LIB=.../local/lib/perl5`.

Setup with Docker
---

Note that travelynx Docker support is experimental and, in its current form,
far from best practices. Pull requests are appreciated.

First, you need to set up a PostgreSQL database so that travelynx can store
user accounts and journeys. It must be at least version 9.4 and must use a
UTF-8 locale. See above (or `examples/docker/postgres-init.sh`) for database
initialization. You do not need to perform the `database migrate` step.

Next, you need to prepare three files that will be mounted into the travelynx
container: travelynx configuration, e-mail configuration, and imprint and
privacy policy. For the sake of this readme, we assume that you are using the
`local/` directory to store these

* `mkdir local`
* copy examples/travelynx.conf to local/travelynx.conf and configure it.
* copy examples/docker/email-transport.sh to local/email-transport.sh and configure it.
  The travelynx container does not contain a mail server, so it needs a
  separate SMTP server to send mail. It does not receive mail.
* create local/imprint.html.ep and enter imprint as well as privacy policy data.
* create local/terms-of-service.html.ep and enter your terms of service.
* Configure your web server to reverse-provy requests to the travelynx
  instance. See `examples/nginx-site` for an nginx config.

travelynx consists of two runtimes: the web application and a background
worker. Your service supervisor (or docker compose / docker stack / kubernetes
setup) should orchestrate them somewhere along these lines.

* `docker pull derfnull/travelynx:latest`
* Start web application: `docker run -p 8093:8093 -v ${PWD}/local:/local:ro travelynx:latest`
* Wait until localhost:8093 responds to requests
* Start worker: `docker run -v ${PWD}/local:/local:ro travelynx:latest worker`

To install an update: stop worker and web application, update the travelynx
image, and start them again. Database migrations will be performed
automatically. Note that downgrades are not supported.

Usage
---

For the sake of this manual, we will assume your travelynx instance is running
on `travelynx.de`

travelynx journey logging is based on checkin and checkout actions: You check
into a train when boarding it, select a destination, and are automatically
checked out when you arrive. Real-time data is saved on both occasions and
continuously updated while in transit, providing an accurate overview of both
scheduled and actual journey times.

## Checking in

You can check into a train up to 30 minutes before its scheduled departure and
up to two hours after its actual departure (including delays).

First, you need to select the station you want to check in from.
Navigate to `travelynx.de` or click/tap on the travelynx text in the navigation
bar. You will see a list of the five stations closest to your current location
(as reported by your browser). Select the station you're at or enter its
name or DS100 code manually.

As soon as you select a train, you will be checked in and travelynx will switch
to the journey / checkout view. If you already know where you're headed, you
should click/tap on the destination station in the station list now. You can
change the destination by selecting a new one anytime.

## Checking out

You are automatically checked out a few minutes after arrival at your
destination. If the train has already arrived when you select a destination and
its arrival was less than two hours ago, you are checked out immediately.  If
it's more than two hours, you need to perform a manual checkout (without
arrival data) using the link at the bottom of the checkin menu's station list.

Testing
---

The test scripts assume that travelynx.conf contains a valid database
connection. They will create a test-specific schema, perform all operations in
it, and then drop the schema. As such, the database specified in the config is
not affected.

Nevertheless, bugs may happen. Do NOT run tests on your production database.
Please use a separate development database instead.

Run the tests by executing `prove`. Use `prove -v` for debug output and
`DBI_TRACE=SQL prove -v` to monitor SQL queries.
